Problem Statement
This program will compute an invoice based on values entered by the user. The invoice computes a
total (Gross) bill amount based on the number of hours invoiced and the hourly rate (the gross amount
is the product of those two values).
The user provides a discount code of 1, 2, or 3. 1 is 10% discount, 2 is 12% discount, 3 is 15% discount.
Any other value results in a discount of 0.0.
An invoice must be printed to the screen.
